# ðŸš€ Dressed MVP - Complete Installation Guide

## Installation Options

You now have **3 different installation scripts** to choose from, depending on your system setup:

### ðŸŽ¯ Option 1: Full Automated Installation (Recommended)

```

```
**Best for:** Systems where Homebrew installation fails
**What it does:**

- Graceful fallback if Homebrew fails

### âš¡ Option 3: No Homebrew Required (Fastest)
```bash
./install-dressed-no-brew.sh
```
**Best for:** Systems with Node.js already installed
**What it does:**

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting the Original Error

The error you encountered:
```
./install-dressed.sh: line 108: cd: dressed: No such file or directory
```
